# astro's "No Farming Community Center Challenge"

## Info
This is a mod that can be used for a challenge to complete the community center without farming.
To be more specific, it is for *not growing crops* challenge. Raising animals is still allowed

For this to be possible, it replaces the Quality Crops bundle with the Fish Farmer's bundle.
**DO NOT USE REMIXED BUNDLES**

In addition, it adds the relevant crafting recipes that you usually get upon levelling your farming skill to Robin's shop for purchase.
This includes:
* Mayonnaise Machine
* Stone Fence
* Bee House
* Farmer's Lunch
* Preserves Jar
* Iron Fence
* Cheese press
* Hardwood Fence
* Loom
* Oil Maker
* Keg


## Required Mods
This requires the Content Patcher mod and Shop Tile Framework to work. Shop Tile framework required Expanded Preconditions, so all the mods required are:
* [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)
* [Shop Tile Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5005)
* [Expanded Preconditions](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6529)


## Optional Mods
The only way to complete quite a lot of the Pantry bundles is via the travelling cart. There is a mod here called [Customizable Cart Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1402) which lets you edit the travelling merchant visiting days. If you find that sleeping every day simply to check the cart on Friday and Sunday boring, then you can make the merchant appear every day! Or, make the merchant stock more items. I would call this easy mode, however this is what I'm doing and I don't want to sell *myself* short.
