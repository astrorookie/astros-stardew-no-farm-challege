# astro's "No Farming Community Center Challenge"

## Info
This is a mod that can be used for a challenge to complete the community center without farming.
To be more specific, it is for *not growing crops* challenge. Raising animals is still allowed

For this to be possible, it replaces the Quality Crops bundle with the Fish Farmer's bundle.
**DO NOT USE REMIXED BUNDLES**

In addition, it adds the relevant crafting recipes that you usually get upon levelling your farming skill to Robin's shop for purchase.
This includes:
* Mayonnaise Machine
* Stone Fence
* Bee House
* Farmer's Lunch
* Preserves Jar
* Iron Fence
* Cheese press
* Hardwood Fence
* Loom
* Oil Maker
* Keg
