# astro's "No Farming Community Center Challenge"

## Info
This is a mod that can be used for a challenge to complete the community center without farming.
To be more specific, it is for *not growing crops* challenge. Raising animals is still allowed

For this to be possible, it replaces the Quality Crops bundle with the Fish Farmer's bundle.
**DO NOT USE REMIXED BUNDLES**

In addition, it adds the relevant crafting recipes that you usually get upon levelling your farming skill to Robin's shop for purchase.
This includes:
* Mayonnaise Machine
* Stone Fence
* Bee House
* Farmer's Lunch
* Preserves Jar
* Iron Fence
* Cheese press
* Hardwood Fence
* Loom
* Oil Maker
* Keg


## Required Mods
This requires the Content Patcher mod and Shop Tile Framework to work. Shop Tile framework required Expanded Preconditions, so all the mods required are:
* [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)
* [Shop Tile Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5005)
* [Expanded Preconditions](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6529)

## 1.6 Update
You will need the alpha version of [Expanded Preconditions](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6529?tab=files) which is here under 'Optional Files'


## Optional Mods
The only way to complete quite a lot of the Pantry bundles is via the travelling cart. 
~~There is a mod here called [Customizable Cart Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1402) which lets you edit the travelling merchant visiting days.~~
**If you are on 1.6, you will need this mod instead**: [Travelling Cart Visit Everyday](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22240?tab=description). If you find that sleeping every day simply to check the cart on Friday and Sunday boring, then you can make the merchant appear every day!
